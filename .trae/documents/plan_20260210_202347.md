I will adjust the plan based on the user's clarification. "最大评论数" (Max Comments) in the context of "Selection Logic" actually refers to the **stopping condition** or **target count** logic, which re-affirms the existing "Max Videos per Keyword" setting but framed as a selection goal.

However, the user phrased it as "Two Video Selection Logics: 1. Strict Keyword Match, 2. Max Comment Count".
If "Max Comment Count" means "Select up to N videos" (which is the default behavior), then "Strict Keyword Match" is an *additional filter*.

Wait, re-reading the user's correction: "最大评论数的意思是 选择达到 运行参数里配置的 最大评论数的视频数进行评论" (Max comments means selecting enough videos to reach the max comment count configured in runtime parameters).
This implies the *standard* behavior: "Comment on N videos".

So the "Two Logics" are likely:
1.  **Strict Keyword Match**: Only select videos where the title *strictly* contains the keyword. (This acts as a filter).
2.  **Standard/Max Count**: Select videos based on search order (or random) until the target count (Max Comments) is reached, *without* strict keyword matching (fuzzy matching by Bilibili).

**Revised Plan**:

1.  **GUI Refactor (`gui.py`)**:
    *   **Group Rename**: Change "搜索筛选" to "综合设置".
    *   **Video List Optimization**:
        *   **Excel-like**: Add alternating row colors (striped), grid lines (if supported by theme), and column sorting.
        *   **Context Menu**: Right-click to "Copy BV", "Open Browser".
    *   **Selection Logic UI**:
        *   Add a new Combobox `Selection Logic` in "综合设置":
            *   Options: "常规模式 (达到数量即停)" (Standard/Max Count), "严格匹配模式 (标题包含关键词)" (Strict Match).
            *   *Note*: This effectively adds a "Strict Title Filter" toggle.

2.  **Configuration (`config.yaml`)**:
    *   Add `search.strategy.strict_title_match` (boolean).

3.  **Backend Logic (`main.py`)**:
    *   **Strict Match Implementation**:
        *   In the video processing loop, if `strict_title_match` is True:
            *   Check `if keyword in video_title`.
            *   If not match: Log "Title mismatch, skipping" and *do not count this towards the target limit*.
            *   Continue fetching/processing until `target_count` valid comments are made or search results exhausted.

4.  **Files to Modify**:
    *   `gui.py`: UI changes.
    *   `config.yaml`: New config key.
    *   `main.py`: Logic to enforce strict title matching during the selection loop.

This interpretation aligns with "Two Logics": one is "Just get N videos" (Standard), the other is "Get N videos *that also match strictly*" (Strict).
