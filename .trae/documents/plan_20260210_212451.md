The user has found that Bilibili *does* support URL parameters for date filtering: `pubtime_begin_s` and `pubtime_end_s` (Unix timestamps). This is excellent news as it is much more reliable than UI automation.

**Plan**:

1.  **Refactor `core/search.py`**:
    *   Update `search_videos` method to accept `time_filter` configuration.
    *   Calculate `pubtime_begin_s` and `pubtime_end_s` based on the filter:
        *   **Recent X Days**:
            *   `end = now`
            *   `begin = now - X days`
        *   **Date Range**:
            *   `begin = start_date`
            *   `end = end_date` (set to end of day 23:59:59)
    *   Convert these to Unix timestamps (integers).
    *   Append `&pubtime_begin_s={...}&pubtime_end_s={...}` to the search URL.
    *   *Important*: The user's example URL is `search.bilibili.com/all`. The current code uses `search.bilibili.com/video`. I should check if parameters work on `/video` too. Usually they do. I will stick to `/video` but add the params. If it fails, I might switch to `/all` but `/video` is preferred for scraping video cards.
    *   *Observation*: The user's link has `vt=...`. I'll ignore `vt` for now unless needed.

2.  **Update `main.py`**:
    *   Pass the `filter_config` (specifically `time_range`) to `search_videos`.
    *   Remove the "Native UI Click" logic (revert or bypass `apply_time_filter`) since URL params are superior.
    *   Keep the **Post-Filtering** as a safety net (double check), or remove it if we trust the URL. I will keep it as a fallback or strict check.

3.  **Files to Modify**:
    *   `core/search.py`: Update URL construction logic.
    *   `main.py`: Update `search_videos` call arguments.

**Revised Plan Steps**:
1.  Modify `search.py` to handle date -> timestamp conversion and URL splicing.
2.  Update `main.py` to pass the filter config to `search_videos`.
3.  Verify the generated URL structure.

This approach is cleaner, faster, and more robust than UI automation.
