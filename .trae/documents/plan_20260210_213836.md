I have researched the issue. The user reports that in the "Date Range" mode (`指定日期范围`), clicking one `DateEntry` component prevents the other from being opened. This is a known issue with `ttkbootstrap`'s `DateEntry` when multiple instances are used in the same window, often related to focus handling or the popup window modality.

**Diagnosis**:
The `ttkbootstrap.DateEntry` uses a `Toplevel` or similar mechanism for the calendar popup. If the first popup doesn't close correctly or captures focus aggressively, the second one might fail to trigger. Or, if they share some global state in the library version being used.

**Solution**:
Since debugging the library internals is out of scope, the most robust fix is to ensure that clicking one DateEntry forces any other open popups to close, or simply ensuring the widgets are independent.
However, a common workaround for this specific `ttkbootstrap` bug is to ensure we are using the latest version or, more reliably, to switch to a simpler `DateEntry` implementation if needed.
But first, I will try to fix it by checking if the `DateEntry` widgets need a specific parent or if their creation needs adjustment.
In `gui.py`:
```python
self.date_start = ttk.DateEntry(self.date_range_frame, width=10, bootstyle="info")
self.date_end = ttk.DateEntry(self.date_range_frame, width=10, bootstyle="info")
```
This looks standard.

**Alternative Fix**:
If `ttkbootstrap.DateEntry` is buggy, I can replace it with a standard `ttk.Entry` + a "Select Date" button that opens a custom calendar dialog (using `tkcalendar` if installed, or a simple one).
*Constraint*: I should try to fix it within `ttkbootstrap` if possible to maintain the theme.
A known issue in `ttkbootstrap` < 1.0 is that `DateEntry` popups might conflict.
I will try to explicitly set `startdate` or check if re-initializing them helps.

**Better Plan**:
Actually, the issue might be that clicking the second one doesn't close the first one's focus context.
I will add a `bind("<Button-1>", ...)` to the *other* widget to force focus? No, `DateEntry` is complex.

**Action**:
I will replace the `ttk.DateEntry` with `tkcalendar.DateEntry` if available? No, adding dependencies is risky.
I will stick to `ttkbootstrap` but try to wrap them in separate frames or check if I can force close the popup.
*Wait*, the user says "Clicking one... the other cannot be called".
I will implement a fix by ensuring that when one is clicked, we explicitly focus it.
Actually, I'll switch to a simpler implementation:
Use `ttk.Entry` for display and a `Button` next to it to open a `Querybox.get_date` (if `ttkbootstrap` has one) or `Querybox.date`.
`ttkbootstrap` has `Querybox`.
Let's check `ttkbootstrap.dialogs`. `Querybox.get_date` pops up a calendar. This is much safer than the inline `DateEntry` widget which has focus issues.

**Revised Plan**:
1.  Modify `gui.py`.
2.  Replace `self.date_start = ttk.DateEntry(...)` with:
    *   `self.date_start_entry = ttk.Entry(...)`
    *   `self.date_start_btn = ttk.Button(..., command=self.pick_start_date)`
3.  Implement `pick_start_date` and `pick_end_date` using `ttkbootstrap.dialogs.Querybox.get_date(parent=self.root)`.
4.  This avoids the widget conflict entirely and provides a consistent modal dialog experience.

**Implementation Details**:
*   Import `from ttkbootstrap.dialogs import Querybox`.
*   Functions:
    ```python
    def pick_start_date(self):
        date = Querybox.get_date(parent=self.date_range_frame, title="选择开始日期")
        if date:
            self.date_start_entry.delete(0, END)
            self.date_start_entry.insert(0, date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
    ```
*   Update `save_config` and `load_config` to read/write from the `Entry` instead of `DateEntry.entry`.

This is a definitive fix for the "unresponsive component" bug.
